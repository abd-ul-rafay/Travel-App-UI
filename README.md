# Travel App
This project is for practice.

## Using Flutter

The Flutter Travel App showcases a stunning user interface, comprising four main screens. The Home screen features a horizontal listview displaying recommended places, alongside a vertical listview presenting all available destinations. The Search screen enables users to explore all listed places conveniently. Additionally, the Favourites screen allows users to bookmark their preferred locations for easy access. Furthermore, a bottom modal sheet dynamically displays detailed information about selected places upon clicking, enhancing the user experience and facilitating seamless navigation throughout the app.
